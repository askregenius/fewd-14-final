                <p>As you can see by the picture to the left my love affair with guitars started a long time ago. Once I received the standing “O” from mom and dad I was hooked. I left the bass guitar to play guitar in 1977. Twenty-five years later after a conversation with an old high school musician friend I decided I wanted to go back to my first love, the bass. After a year or so the old heavy p-bass just wasn’t working for me. Since I was starting over I decided to go with a 5-string. Call it fate or destiny, but I have been in construction all my life. I had the tools, ability and knowledge of instruments; soon I decided I would build my own. After completing the first bass, at the first gig out, as I was sound checking the sound man mixing monitors</p>

                <p> was close by and without raising a head to look I heard him say, “Killer sounding bass.” Sound men hardly ever comment on tone! A couple of weeks later a fellow bass player and friend who happens to play bass for reknowned dobro player Jerry Douglas was checking it out and asked if he could borrow it for a while and take it out on the road. Since I wanted to hear some feedback from the "big time" I agreed. That bass has been on the road ever since. Well of course I had to have another one, and since then I have been building regularly. With the encouragement of family, friends and fellow musicians I am starting a website. If you are interested in having a bass or guitar built or just want to look at the weekly blog of progress on instruments</p>

                <p>being built, I appreciate your interest.
                Every instrument is made in my small shop at home by me and my son (who is also part of the reason I had to start building guitars). We build a limited number of instruments per year by hand. No CNC machines for mass production here. I started out with the philosophy that I would build what I wanted and hoped that others would like it also. I am all about quality, options and made in the good ole USA. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with your thoughts on what you are looking for in an instrument and together we will try to make your dream guitar a reality.</p>
